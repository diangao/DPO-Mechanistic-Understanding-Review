# Review of "A Mechanistic Understanding of Alignment Algorithms: A Case Study on DPO and Toxicity"

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for a technical review of the paper "A Mechanistic Understanding of Alignment Algorithms: A Case Study on DPO and Toxicity" (2024). The review analyzes how this paper provides a mechanistic investigation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its role in reducing toxic generations in language models. The review examines the paper's key contributions in understanding alignment through activation steering rather than capability erasure, while also discussing its limitations and broader implications for the field.
